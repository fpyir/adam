      <h3 class="lato f3 fw7 ph5-ns ph3">About Me</h3>
      <p class="lato mw7 lh-copy ph5-ns ph3">
        I’m a self taught machine learning engineer with a unique full stack developer toolkit; I’ve worked on all aspects of the machine learning pipeline as well as cutting edge frontend development & enterprise integration systems. My main areas of expertise
        are in production grade AI systems; specifically I have the most experience in computer vision & search.
      </p>
      <p class="lato mw7 lh-copy ph5-ns ph3">
        Currently I am working as the lead machine learning engineer for <b>Collaboro</b>. I am in charge of creating a first-in-the-industry computer vision pipeline for our clients media assets. We work with clients such as Qantas, Hungry Jacks & McDonalds
        to create high quality metadata to improve search results utilising custom models & third party solutions all integrated together using ensemble techniques to boost reliability and prediction confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="lato mw7 lh-copy ph5-ns ph3">
        My unquenchable thirst for knowledge & hunger for challenges has seen me procure a rather unusual toolkit of software development skills. Not only am I fluent across the entire stack - whether that's RESTful API's, GraphQL Service layers, Modern SPA apps
        or traditional static sites - but also possess in depth knowledge of modern cloud architecture. Working with the building blocks of tomorrow's biggest applications I deliver thoroughly performant & scalable software.

      <p class="lato  lh-copy">
        While I am by no means a designer, I am a highly capable web developer that loves working with the latest JavaScript tech. VueJS is my preferred development framework, and Tachyons + SCSS is my go-to for styling. Some of the best work I have done in the
        space involved modernising an old Angular application & increasing page load speeds by 700%.

      <h3 class="lato gray fw7">NO.2 API DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <p class="lato lh-copy">
        Utilising game-changing cloud technologies, and any tech stack of your choice, I work to deliver API-first backend systems upon which user experiences are built. While I can work with any backend technology out there, I am most productive in .NET Core
        and Flask. My extensive knowledge of cloud architecture & best practices means I can not only implement but also design these systems. </p>

      <h3 class="lato gray fw7">NO.3 MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
      <p class="lato lh-copy">
        I first got involved in software properly when I developed a NLP-based chatbot at 15 - before I even knew what a chatbot was & without the faintest knowledge of NLP. Since then, machine learning has been my favourite application of technology ever. I
        have deep domain knowledge in computer vision and cutting edge neural network architectures.
