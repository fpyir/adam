        <h2 class="lato f2 lh-title">API's</h2>
        <p class="lato lh-copy f4 mw7">
          Today’s applications are expected to deliver the same user experience and functionality across all platforms; phone, tablet, computer, internet, and soon voice. The only way to do this is by taking an API-first approach; encaspulating business logic &
          data access and leaving the interface layer to the client. Furthermore, modern day cloud technology means API’s today can be drastically cheaper than they were yesterday.
        </p>
        <p class="lato lh-copy f4 mw7">
          Since Day 1 I have been an API-first developer. Recently, my skillset has grown to include in depth knowledge of cloud architecture and serverless designs. In my professional career I have developed & maintained more than three dozen business-critical
          API endpoints.
        </p>
        <p class="lato lh-copy f4 mw7">
          I can build, deploy and manage Cloud-First API’s in C#, Python & JavaScript.

        <p class="lato  lh-copy">
          How many users do you expect your product to have in the next month? Six months? Three years? Poor architectural and technical design choices made at the MVP level can and often do plague your development efforts for months to come. I’ve delivered production
          systems that have handled terabytes of data a month and thousands of requests a day - scalability is my mother tongue.
        </p>

      <div class="w-25-ns">
        <h3 class="lato gray fw7 tc">EXTENSIBLE</h3>
        <p class="lato lh-copy">
          Software is never static - you always need new features, new fixes, new designs, new capabilities. And a static API is a dead API; this is the inherit peril of outsourcing development work. Contractors and consultants will deliver API’s that meets the
          specs and satisifes the contract - frequently with little thought beyond it. I build API with future development in mind - the longevity of any project I make is as important to me as the inital build.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-25-ns">
        <h3 class="lato gray fw7 tc">PROFITABLE</h3>
        <p class="lato lh-copy">
          Everything costs something - and while hardware is drastically cheaper than the cost of developing the software it runs, it still costs something. And that something is recurring and grows with user base. But done correctly a modern, cloud first API rarely
          costs more than a cup of coffee a week (and in a lot of cases, it can be completely free) when you’re not at Netflix-scale. That’s why I combine my extensive knowledge of cloud architecture with API development to deliver extreme profit margins.

        <h2 class="lato f2 lh-title">Machine Learning.</h2>
        <p class="lato lh-copy f4 mw7">
          In the last several years as machine learning technology has evolved at an ever accelerating pace, the industry has gathered a lot of hype & misconception. But despite the buzz and poor execution on great ideas (remember chatbots?) machine learning has
          the potential to fundamentally improve the user experience of almost every piece of software out there.
        </p>
        <p class="lato lh-copy f4 mw7">
          I’m not a traditionally trained ML engineer, and that’s because the traditional approach doesn’t work. What you need isn’t a fancy custom algoritihm and a PhD vetted data science report. What you need are machine learning features & optimisations that
          improve the end user experience. Whether that’s through computer vision, deep personalisation, computer-assisted customer service or machine automated functionality, the difficulty is in identifying the opportunities and delivering them into
          production.
        </p>
        <p class="lato lh-copy f4 mw7">
          What you need are practical machine learning solutions, not data reports and research papers. That’s where I come in.

          I combine my machine learning & data science experience with my knowledge of cloud first backend development in order to not only carry out data analysis & model creation, but deliver them in production ready systems. So instead of needing a data scientist,
          machine learning engineer & a backend developer, you get the benefit of one touch point for the entire process.

      <div class="w-30-ns">
        <h3 class="lato gray fw7 tc">CUSTOMER FOCUSED</h3>
        <p class="lato lh-copy">
          I’m not a full stack machine learning engineer because I love code & AI. I’m in it because I’m deeply passionate about improving products. I can help analyse and identify opportunities for AI improvements by getting to know your product inside & out.
          I often find that sales people, customer service representatives & client relation managers are bursting with valuable insights - they just don’t have the technical toolkit to express them.
